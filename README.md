# poopup

The premier image popup solution for REPL driven development in Clojure

## Usage

```clojure
(ns dev
  (:require [poopup.lol :as lol]
            [clojure.java.io :as io))

;;; A resource
(def image (io/resource "myimage.png"))

(lol/poopup image)

;;; A url on the internet
(lol/poopup "https://somepublicimageurl/image.png")
```

## How does it work?

Yuck! It uses `clojure` to call `poopup.main` which uses swing and awt to display the image
in it's very own JVM.

## But why?

Just quick and dirty image previewing while working in the REPL. Something like checking out an image generated by OpenAI or something
like that. Separate JVM ensures your REPL is safe. Secure. Loved.
